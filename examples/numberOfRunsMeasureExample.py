"""numberOfRunsMeasureExample

    Created on Tue Jul  14 16:42 2025

    Example script for measuring with a Tausand Tempico device using extended 
    number of runs (1000), and using Mode 2 (125 ns â€“ 4 ms range) on Channel 1.

    This example connects to the Tempico device, configures it to only enable 
    Channel 1, sets the measurement mode to Mode 2, and adjusts the number of 
    runs (measurements) to 1000. It then starts a single measurement operation 
    and reads the resulting data.

    The key feature demonstrated here is the use of `setNumberOfRuns(1000)`, 
    which tells the device to internally perform 1000 measurements in response 
    to a single call to `measure()`. This is ideal for bulk acquisition workflows 
    where multiple time intervals are collected automatically.

    Instructions:
        - Make sure the `pyTempico` package is installed.
        - Replace `'COM5'` with the serial port corresponding to your device.
        - Connect appropriate start/stop signals to the Tempico device.
        - Run the script. If no signals are present, the measurement will return 
          an empty array.
